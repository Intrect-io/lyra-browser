"""Assembling a lyra-browser server for one persona run.

The same server as ``build_server`` — same tools, permissions, guard and audit
log — with three differences: the configuration comes from the run spec (a
headless window of the persona's size, a profile of its own, the target's
sites trusted and nothing else, consent pinned to ``elicit`` so nobody can
answer for the user), the tools the persona is not offered are switched off,
and ``UatMiddleware`` records and guards every call.

``serve_stdio`` is what ``lyra-browser --uat-run <run.json>`` runs: an external
harness (Claude Code, Codex) spawns it as its MCP server and the run's files
appear in the run directory exactly as they would from our own loop.

  means the budget is spent: report what remains with report_finding and call
  finish.
- report_finding, verdict, note and finish write the run's report. finish ends
  the run; after it every browser tool answers "finished".
- blocked_by_uat_policy means the server refused something the persona must never
  do (a card number, a file outside its upload directory). Do not try another way.
